# Neil sequencer

This is a WIP update and GTK2->GTK3 (GTK4 TODO!) port of the Neil sequencer.

Neil is a modular/tracker/DAW hybrid in the style of Jeskola Buzz, original developed
by Leonard "paniq" Ritter (the app was first named Aldrin (no points for spotting the pattern))
and then maintained by Vytautas "orbitfold" Janƒçauskas at which point the name was change to "Neil".

I am attempting the ressurect Neil as I have a few dozen tracks in `.ccm` format that I
am quite keen to hear again.

## Build/Run
